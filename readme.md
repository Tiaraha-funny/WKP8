## My reports

### 1- The structure of my project.

- I build a html and named the class needed
- I drag the elements wich I need from the html to the js code
- I create a new big array to handle the lists will be given from the input
- I created html in my js code for setting the lists songs wich relies on the ampty array


### 2- If I had more time, I need to improve these things

- I am still strugling to use the dataset and the id.
- Accessing the local storage
- Increasing number by clicking to the list
- using map properly

### 3- New thing that I learn from this project

- I don't really have new things to learn

### 4- The most challenging part for me

- Increasing number
- deleting lists
- searching another lists

### 5- More explanation about a specific topic

I need more explanation about using dataset and the id, and also, the local storage.
Explanation about deleting and accessing the reseach inside the lists 

### 6- Any comments

- There are an expected thing: when I click the increasement button it increase in the console log, I didn't have much time to fix it so I have to leave it there.

- I have got error that I couldn't solve. When I click my delete button, it throws an error. It is because of my local storage.

- I couldn't have anytime to do my css or to style it beautifully so I just leave there too.

**I am very sorry from all bad things happening: error and bad css**
